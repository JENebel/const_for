//! 
//! Regular for loops are not allowed in const contexts, because it relies on iterators, which are not available in const.\
//! This is rather annoying when writing const functions, as you need to write custom for loops using 'loop' or 'while'.
//! 
//! This crate provides a macro implementation of a for loop over a range that is usable in const contexts.\
//! The aim is to imitate a regular for loop as closely as possible. It handles break and continue correctly, and the variable is immutable in the body.\
//! To make the for loop as versatile as possible, it comes with macro variants to handle .rev() and step_by(x), which imitates the respective function calls.
//! This is necessary, as normally they depend on non-const iterators. But they can be used here with identical syntax.
//! 
//! The main restriction is that the macro only supports standard(exclusive) ranges, eg. 0..10 and -5..5, but not ..5 or 0..=10. This is mostly a limit of current stable Rust, and wont be possible without using nightly before #![feature(const_range_bounds)] becomes stable.
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! let mut a = 0;
//! const_for!(i in 0..5 => {
//!     a += i
//! });
//! assert!(a == 10)
//! ```
//! 
//! This is equivalent to the following regular for loop, except it is usable in const context.
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! let mut a = 0;
//! for i in 0..5 {
//!     a += i
//! }
//! assert!(a == 10)
//! ```
//! 
//! ## Custom step size
//! 
//! A custom step size can be set:
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! let mut v = Vec::new();
//! const_for!(i in (0..5).step_by(2) => {
//!     v.push(i)
//! });
//! assert!(v == vec![0, 2, 4])
//! ```
//! 
//! The loop behaves as if the function was called on the range, but it is implemented by a macro.\
//! It is equivalent to the following non-const loop:
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! let mut v = Vec::new();
//! for i in (0..5).step_by(2) {
//!     v.push(i)
//! }
//! assert!(v == vec![0, 2, 4])
//! ```
//! 
//! ## Reversed
//! 
//! Iteration can be reversed:
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! let mut v = Vec::new();
//! const_for!(i in (0..5).rev() => {
//!     v.push(i)
//! });
//! assert!(v == vec![4, 3, 2, 1, 0])
//! ```
//! 
//! The loop behaves as if the function was called on the range, but it is implemented by a macro.\
//! It is equivalent to the following non-const loop:
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! let mut v = Vec::new();
//! for i in (0..5).rev() {
//!     v.push(i)
//! }
//! assert!(v == vec![4, 3, 2, 1, 0])
//! ```
//! 
//! ## Reversed and custom step size
//! 
//! It is possible to combine rev and step_by, but each can only be appended once. So the following two examples are the only legal combinations.
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! // Reverse, then change step size
//! let mut v = Vec::new();
//! const_for!(i in (0..10).rev().step_by(4) => {
//!     v.push(i)
//! });
//! assert!(v == vec![9, 5, 1]);
//! 
//! // Change step size, then reverse
//! let mut v = Vec::new();
//! const_for!(i in (0..10).step_by(4).rev() => {
//!     v.push(i)
//! });
//! assert!(v == vec![8, 4, 0])
//! ```
//! 
//! ## Note
//! 
//! The body of the loop can be any statement. This means that the following is legal, even though it is not in a regular for loop.
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! let mut a = 0;
//! const_for!(i in 0..5 => a += i);
//! 
//! # unsafe fn unsafe_function() {}
//! const_for!(i in 0..5 => unsafe {
//!    unsafe_function()
//! });
//! ```
//! 
//! ### Real world example
//! 
//! Here is an example of how this crate helped make some actual code much nicer and readable.
//! 
//! The code was taken (and edited a bit for clarity) from the [Cadabra](https://github.com/JENebel/Cadabra/) chess engine.
//! 
//! Before:
//! 
//! ```
//! const fn gen_white_pawn_attacks() -> [u64; 64] {
//!     let mut masks = [0; 64];
//!     
//!     let mut rank: u8 = 0;
//!     while rank < 8 {
//!         let mut file: u8 = 0;
//!         while file < 8 {
//!             let index = (rank*8+file) as usize;
//!             if file != 7 { masks[index] |= (1 << index) >> 7 as u64 }
//!             if file != 0 { masks[index] |= (1 << index) >> 9 as u64 }
//! 
//!             file += 1;
//!         }
//!         rank += 1;
//!     }
//! 
//!     masks
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! After:
//! 
//! ```
//! # use const_for::*;
//! const fn gen_white_pawn_attacks() -> [u64; 64] {
//!     let mut masks = [0; 64];
//!     
//!     const_for!(rank in 0..8 => {
//!         const_for!(file in 0..8 => {
//!             let index = (rank*8+file) as usize;
//!             if file != 7 { masks[index] |= (1 << index) >> 7 as u64 }
//!             if file != 0 { masks[index] |= (1 << index) >> 9 as u64 }
//!         })
//!     });
//! 
//!     masks
//! }
//! ```
